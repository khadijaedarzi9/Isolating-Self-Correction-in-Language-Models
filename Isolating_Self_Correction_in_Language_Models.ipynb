        "A controlled fallback pipeline was implemented to induce explicit self-correction behavior if fewer than ten natural backtracking cases were observed during baseline inference. This mechanism injects a deliberate numerical error into an otherwise correct reasoning trace and allows the model to continue generation, retaining only examples where the model explicitly detects and corrects the mistake. In the current experiment, all baseline examples were solved correctly without backtracking, so the fallback was intentionally not activated (seen in the next step). The code is retained to demonstrate methodological completeness and to support future experiments with more challenging tasks."

However, in the baseline inference and manual labeling phase, none of the 50 generated reasoning traces exhibited explicit backtracking or self-correction all examples were classified as no_error. Because this \"Token-level annotation\" is defined only over error_with_backtracking cases, there were no valid examples on which to apply token-level event annotation, and this step was intentionally not executed. A controlled fallback mechanism for inducing self-correction was implemented (Part 1b) but was not activated in this experiment in order to preserve the natural distribution of model behavior; future experiments using more challenging tasks may trigger this pathway and enable this part analysis."

        "Baseline inference on Qwen-2.5-7B yielded near-zero spontaneous backtracking events, consistent with the model's high arithmetic competence on this dataset. We initially attempted to elicit correction behavior via post-hoc corruption of intermediate numeric values in otherwise correct reasoning traces. While this intervention reliably produced inconsistencies, the resulting generations rarely exhibited genuine self-correction. Instead, we observed a consistent behavioral pattern in which the model deferred to the corrupted premise, effectively treating the corruption as ground truth rather than representing an internal realization of error. This appears to reflect a strong sycophantic prior toward user-provided text, which dominates arithmetic consistency under string-level corruption. Because this confound makes it difficult to isolate the internal “mistake realization” signal of interest, we pivoted to a prompt-based induction of self-correction via few-shot exemplars. Although this approach induces backtracking behavior rather than relying on natural failures, it preserves causal continuity within the autoregressive process and yields clean, internally generated correction events suitable for mechanistic analysis. Notably, the failure of the corruption-based approach itself highlights sycophancy as a distinct and measurable behavioral mode, which we treat as an auxiliary observation rather than the primary object of study."

This is not a failure of the setup, but a consequence of model competence: on sufficiently simple tasks, the model does not enter unstable reasoning states that require correction. However, the absence of such events prevents direct study of the internal signals associated with error realization. To obtain sufficient instances of self-correction for mechanistic analysis, we therefore pivot from observing spontaneous failures to inducing correction behavior via prompt design. This shift is methodological rather than conceptual: the goal is not to study why the model makes mistakes, but to isolate and characterize the internal state corresponding to recognizing and correcting an error, regardless of whether the error arises naturally or is induced."

Instead, the model frequently propagated the injected error forward without entering a revision phase. One plausible interpretation is that the model treats user-provided intermediate states as authoritative, privileging protocol compliance over internal consistency. This behavior is consistent with prior observations of sycophancy-like effects, though we do not attempt to isolate or characterize this phenomenon here. We therefore treat Experiment B as an informative failure mode rather than a suitable basis for isolating a correction signal.\n",

Although the resulting backtracking behavior is induced rather than spontaneous, the transition from error propagation to correction is generated endogenously by the model. This protocol yields consistent and well-localized correction events (100% backtracking, N=50), providing a tractable substrate for the mechanistic analyses in subsequent sections."
